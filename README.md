## Project Objective
The requirements of the project are as follows:
<ul>
<li>An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.</li>
<li>An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.</li>
<li>If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application.</li>
<li>The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.</li>
<li>The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.</li>
<li>As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.</li>
<li>The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.</li>
